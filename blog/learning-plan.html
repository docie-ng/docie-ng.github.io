      <h1 id="welcome-message">Learning Plan</h1>

      <h3>Long term goals:</h3>
      <p class= "quicksand">My long term career goal is to work in the tech industry. 
      I am hoping that upon becoming a web developer, I am able to expand my skill set and work in other areas such as app development, testing or becoming a scrum master. 
      <br>
      <br>
      My long term personal goal is to use my tech skills that I get from Dev Academy to help the organisation sector. </p>
<h3>Helps and hinders for my learning:</h3>
<p class="quicksand"> Attributes which will help and hinder my learning are:
  <br>
  <br>
My adaptability:
<br>
My adaptability helps my learning as I am open to new situations and working with people. 
As I am learning this new and hard skill, I am willing to put in the effort to get the most out of it.  
<br>
<br>
My organisation:
<br>
Given the workload within this course, my ability to remain organised will ensure that I meet daily and weekly tasks. 
Not just within DA, but also outside in my personal life, it ensures that I stay committed to my other commitments. 
<br>
<br>
My curiosity:
<br>
Although my curiosity has led me to my current life path, I can get too wrapped up in the finer details. 
I forget the bigger picture or get too caught up in details that actually do not matter. I end up wasting energy and effort. 
<br>
<br>
My perfectionism: 
<br>
I can spend too much unnecessary time trying to make things exactly how I envisioned it. 
I am learning to be okay when things are not 100% how I wanted them. </p>

<h3>How I will execute being a student at Dev Academy:</h3> 
<p class= "quicksand">To start the day, I always set a work goal/intention. 
This keeps me accountable and ensures that I am finishing tasks on time. 
I’ve been using my google calendar for a hearty 9 years now. 
It’s the only system I use to organise everything.
<br>
<br>
In terms with others, I approach all people with manaakitanga. 
I have many ways I emotionally regulate - I journal, meditate (not all the time), exercise and keep the social calendar booked. 
These activities protect my well-being and ensure that my best self can show up to learn. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
Practising mindfulness is important to me so if I find that things are getting to much, I will:
<br>
<br>
1. Take a step back and reflect on what is stressing me out through journaling.
<br>
2. Consult someone in my personal support system so that I am heard.
<br>
3. Consult people in my network who have already been through DA to see if I am able to get a solution to how I am feeling.
<br>
4. Execute the solution and approach facilitators if needed. 
<br>
<br>
I will start to seek help:
<br>
- When I do not understand how to fix a problem after spending my own time on it. 
<br>
- If I start to notice that I am unable to enjoy things outside of DA because I am too stressed or worried about the work.
<br>
<br>
During my time at DA, I want to work on my ability to give and receive feedback, dealing with conflict/ mediating tough conversations.
<br>
<br>
I expect the facilitation team to be patient, kind and enthusiastic. 
I expect the facilitation team to provide me with support (even when I might not know I need it) and to provide a safe space for making mistakes and creating relationships.</p>
