      <h3>What is emotional intelligence?</h3>
      <div class="quicksand">
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is the term used to describe how our neural pathways change through intentional exposure to experiences. 
        This means that our brain is adaptable and with constant exposure to an experience, habit or skill we are able to solidify 
        these pathways so that it becomes second nature. The same goes in reverse too, where the neural pathways we no longer use 
        weakens. 
        <br>
        <br>
        You can literally do anything: 
        <br>
        Once you realise that you do not have to be smart or talented to pick up a certain skill or habit, you are able to conquer 
        anything. With enough exposure, willpower and intentional repeated practice, you are able to follow your curiosity and 
        desires to become really good at something. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Neuroplasticity can improve your wellbeing:
        <br>
        Challenging yourself with a new positive habit or skill can improve your wellbeing no matter what age you are. By engaging in 
        activities which challenge us positively, we are creating new neural pathways and therefore keeping our brain active and in 
        good shape. By doing so we are more likely to have better cognition! 
        <br>
        <br>
        Neuroplasticity is used in both mental and physical rehab to help people who have been through trauma to help with things 
        such as regain motor control and manage their anxiety. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Given all the information on neuroplasticity, I will use it to my advantage while on my coding journey. With repeated 
        intentional practice, I will seek out ways I am able to understand concepts and to practice coding in my spare time.

      <h3>Increase your neuroplasticity</h3>
      <div class="quicksand">
      <p>
          Ways to increase your neuroplasticity could look like:
          <br>
          - Finding a community that would help you grow 
         <br>
          - Set the same time aside everyday to practice 
         <br>
          - Use different research tools to help better your understanding
          <br>
          - Find a mentor to learn more from 
          <br>
          - Talk to someone outside of your community about your journey/ your new skill you are acquiring to help strengthen your 
          own understanding of the topic. 
      </p>
      </div>
      <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
      <div class="quicksand">
      <p>
        According to Carol Dweck, adopting a growth mindset is realising that your success depends on time and effort. 
        This means that you are able to become really good at something with time and energy. This can look like embracing failures, 
        seeking challenges and learning from criticism.
        This is relevant because I am on a journey learning a new skill. As long as I am putting in the mahi, 
        I will get the treats. With consistent effort, I will get better with time! 
        <br>
        <br>
        In this exploration nothing surprised me but I do feel more motivated to put in more energy and effort into learning. 
        Learning how to code can be really challenging at times and I can get frustrated but after researching about 
        neuroplasticity and growth mindset, itâ€™s a lot more attainable. This gives me more confidence and I feel like I will be 
        dealing with less procrastination. I have realised the importance of time and energy and how it is needed to solidify 
        those connections in my brain in order for something to become second nature and thus to be successful. 
        The idea of neuroplasticity and growth mindset reminds me of the concept of grit. Psychologist Angela Duckworth who 
        popularised the idea of grit reveals that natural talent can only take you so far when achieving a long term goal. 
        <br>
        If you have passion and perseverance for a long term goal you can be even more successful than people who just have natural 
        talent.

         <h3>Learning journey intergration</h3>
          <div class="quicksand">
           <p> 
             Using a growth mindset, I will learn from my mistakes and seek out activities that will push me outside my comfort zone. 
             By doing so, I am expanding my comfort zone and my knowledge toolbox. A current hindrance in my learning is that I spend 
             too much time on the unnecessary details. Although time is a key factor in becoming better at skill, I need to be more 
             cognisant of how I am distributing my time and energy. By focusing on the small details, I am losing time by not 
             practising.
