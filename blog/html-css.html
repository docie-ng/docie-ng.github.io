    <h3>What is a class?</h3>
     <p>A class, like the name states, is a classifier. 
       This means that a class is able to style a group of HTML elements. 
        With class selectors, you can have many within an HTML element and many throughout the HTML sheet.
        <!-- Think of a class like your own culture. Your culture is an identifier for people, but some people may also share the same culture as you. 
        Just like with culture, people can have many cultures that make up them.--> 
        <br>

        In CSS, class is represented with a period then the class name. </p> 

        
      <p>Here is an example: </p>
      
    
    <h3>What is an id?</h3>
      <p> An id is a unique identifier. It is used to style a single element within HTML. It can only be used once within an HTML sheet. 
          Think of id as your fingerprint. It is unique to you, and (in most cases) cannot be used by anyone else. 
          In CSS an id is represented with a # then followed with the id name.
          Here is an example: </p>

      <p> It is important to note that because ids are super specific and special, they will always override a class selector.</p>

    <h3>When should I use a class?</h3>
      <p> You can use class when you are wanting to group related styles together. For example, all the subheadings on your website will be styled the same way.</p>

    <h3>What should I use an id?</h3>
    <p> An id should be used when you are wanting to style one element specifically. For example, you wish to create a round border on a specific photo.</p>
