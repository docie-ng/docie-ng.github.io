      <h3>A time when I was blocked on a problem</h3>
      <div class="quicksand">
      <p>
        A time when I was blocked on a simple problem was during the second round of repl.it. 
        I was stuck on one of the early questions. I talked out loud and broke the error down by writing what I thought it meant. 
        I looked at the testing code to see if I was on the right track with what I understood from the error. I then took a break and reached out for help. 
        <br>
        Throughout the process, I did feel quite frustrated as I was inputting code that was not working. I knew the answer was simple 
        and I was overthinking it. I learnt to not let code get the best of me haha. 
        That reaching out to a friend to keep you in check is always a good idea when you are feeling frustrated.

        <div class="quicksand">
        <p>
          A time when I solved a problem was when I was trying to figure out how the syntax was meant to be when writing 
          a piece of code. 
          Googling and then trying something out. Over and over again until I got it right. Throughout the process when I was trying to figure it out, I felt 
          determined and impatient. I knew that I could get the answer and therefore was trying to input any blocks of code. 
          I learnt that I need to be patient with myself!

       <h3>Reflection on below techniques</h3>
       <div class="quicksand">
        <p> 
          Pseudocode
          <br>
          The action of pseudocoding feels natural, but the actual content of what to type I still need to work on. 
          My sentences can get too long and unnecessarily complicated. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Trying something
          <br>
          This is a technique that I always do once I think I have Googled the correct thing. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Rubber ducky method
          <br>
          This is something that I feel confident in doing and use it as one of my main techniques. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Reading error messages
          <br>
          This is something I need to actively look out for, after this week I have realised how important error messages are.
          They are like little clues to helping you fix your code. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Console.logging
          <br>
          Not entirely confident with this and need to practise it more! 
          <br>
          <br>
          Googling
          <br>
          Google is my main go to, but I can be quite overwhelmed with the amount of information. I want to refine my Google so
          it is a lot more efficient for when I am needing information.
          <br>
          <br>
          Asking your peers for help
          <br> 
          This is something I always do, it's also a great way to share ideas and I tend to gain a different perspective on
          solving a problem.
          <br>
          <br>
          Asking coaches for help
          <br>
          Out of all the techniques, this one is probably I need to work on the most. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Improving your process with reflection
          <br>
          This is something I actively do to check in with not only the thought process but also how I was feeling.
